# Bikesharing

## Overview

### Purpose
The goal of this project is helping us the visualize bike sharing data for further analysis by showing the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders, the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week and the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week. These visualized data could help us to build up more deeper analysis to track the users habits.
